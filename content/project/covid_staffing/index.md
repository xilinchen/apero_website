My lab and a bunch of volunteers worked closely and built this toolkit for hospitals in need.

We were able to build and deliver this very comprehensive website in 2 months. I learned Shiny and built apps all within 2 month. It was a lot hard work. But I was super proud of what we have accomplished!

I was the main contributor to this two dashboards.

  Hi, I am Xilin. It's pronounced as She-Lin. For these who know Pinyin, Xi is first tone and Lin is 2nd tone :）. I am a senior statistician at the Center for Surgical Training and Research at the [University of Michigan](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/surgery/news/archive/201903/center-surgical-training-research). In my current position, I work with a group of smart people to help improve surgical education in the US and around the world!

  I'm originally from [Chengdu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu) and moved to the U.S. for my master's degree. I have been staying in the U.S. since then. My career has been majorly focus on data  analysis in healthcare including outcome research, surgical education, trauma transportation and substance abuse. I enjoy working in a diverse team to solve challenging problems. 

  In my free time, I like going for walks, gardening, cooking, traveling and trying new restaurants!

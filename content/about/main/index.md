  Hi, I am Xilin. It's pronounced as She-Lin(She -first tone, Lin -3rd tone for these who know). My Chinese name writes as 陈熙琳. I am currently working as a senior statistician at the [Center for Surgical Training and Research](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/surgery/news/archive/201903/center-surgical-training-research) at the University of Michigan. In my current position, I work with a group of smart people to help improve surgical education in the US and around the world!

  I'm originally from [Chengdu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu) and moved to the U.S. many years ago for my master's degree. My career has been majorly focus on healthcare related research including substance abuse, trauma transportation and surgical education. I enjoy working in a diverse team to solve challenging problems. 

  In my free time, I like going for walks, gardening, cooking, and trying new restaurants!
